# Global Temperature Heat Map

This project visualizes global temperature data using a heat map, inspired by FreeCodeCamp's Data Visualization challenges. It was built using D3.js, focusing on fulfilling specific user stories for functional completeness and user interactivity.

## Project Overview
The heat map displays monthly temperature variations across different years. It includes the following features:

- Interactive Heat Map: Hover over cells to see the temperature for a specific month and year.
- Color-Coded Legend: Represents temperature ranges, with discrete color bands for easy interpretation.
- X and Y Axes: Display years and months, respectively.
- Tooltip: Provides detailed information when hovering over a cell.

## Features
- **Interactive Heat Map**: Cells representing temperature data change color based on the temperature value.
- **Color-Coded Legend**: A legend visually represents different temperature ranges.
- **Tooltip**: Displays the corresponding year, month, and temperature when a user hovers over a heat map cell.
- **Axes**: The x-axis represents years, and the y-axis represents months, both labeled appropriately.
  
## Technologies Used
- HTML: Structure of the web page.
- CSS: Styles for the heat map and other elements.
- JavaScript: Logic and interactivity, with D3.js used for data manipulation and rendering.
- D3.js: A JavaScript library for creating dynamic, interactive data visualizations.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shishwami/FCC-Heat-Map.git
   ```
2. Open index.html in a web browser to view the heat map.

## Usage
 - Hover over cells: Hover over any cell in the heat map to see detailed information about the temperature for that month and year.
 - Legend: Use the color-coded legend to understand the temperature scale represented in the heat map.

## Dependencies
 - D3.js: JavaScript library used to create the heat map and other data visualizations.

## Credits
This Global Temperature Heat Map project is part of the [FreeCodeCamp Data Visualization certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-heat-map). It was completed as one of the required projects in the curriculum.
